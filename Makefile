# GammaMarkets qualification harness — canonical command surface (D-06, D-07, D-12).
#
# One canonical command (`make verify`) runs the complete qualification suite
# for the selected profile (SQLite when LNBITS_DATABASE_URL is unset/empty,
# PostgreSQL otherwise — exactly like the pinned host) and emits the durable
# evidence bundle. Named subsets are pure `pytest -m` selections over the same
# single test tree for the impact-based development loop (D-12); only
# `make verify` (and the CI profiles) produce durable evidence.

PYTHON ?= python3

# pytest exit code 5 means "no tests collected": a named subset with no tests
# yet (e.g. protocol before plan 01-02) is reported as empty, not failed —
# a FAILING test inside a subset still fails the subset.
SUBSET_OK = rc=$$?; if [ $$rc -eq 5 ]; then echo "subset empty: no tests collected"; exit 0; fi; exit $$rc
