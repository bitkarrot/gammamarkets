tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - LocalRelay deterministic fixtures (ACCEPTING/REJECTING/SILENT modes) — per-relay ACK classification is the only publication evidence; WebSocket send alone is never evidence
    - Golden fixtures + seeded generated cases: NIP-17 recipient/sender/retry wrap chains, NIP-89 31989/31990 pair + naddr, NIP-15 stall/product + invalid DTOs
    - P0-14 closure gate reads the spec at test time: §5 routes from fenced blocks, §7 machines from arrow notation + evidence-gated prose rules, §4 tables from heading/introduction patterns — bidirectional diffs both directions
    - Evidence-closure assertion consumes the plugin's live in-session accumulator (never the serialized manifest) and self-skips whenever a -m/-k/positional selection narrows the run

key-decisions:
  - "Relay ACK classification is the relay_publications vocabulary (accepted/rejected/timeout): SendEventOutput.success/.failed per-relay sets; a missing OK classifies as timeout — never inferred from send success."
  - "P0-14 spec extraction is literal: §5 fenced route blocks (with the member-vs-collection [/{id}] convention), §7 arrow notation + prose rules gated on evidence substrings, §4 tables from heading/bullet/colon introductions — every registered literal positively appears in the spec."
  - "Evidence closure consumes the live accumulator via the evidence_results fixture (shared p0_coverage derivation with the serializer) and self-skips under any selection — marker, -k, or positional args beyond testpaths."
  - "Section-4 table scope is explicit in the registry: every spec table is classified modeled / fk-subset / not-modeled — a missing classification is a registry bug that fails the gate."

# Phase 01 Plan 03: Protocol Fixtures + Closure Gate Summary

**Deterministic protocol evidence and the contract-closure gate: relay ACK classification, NIP-17/NIP-89/NIP-15 golden fixtures, auth/privacy/lifecycle probes, the Decimal/FX boundary with a measured float error, and the P0-14 gate proving spec<->registry<->implementation closure plus complete P0-01..P0-14 evidence — 220/220 on SQLite and PostgreSQL**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~50 min (executor tasks 1-2 committed `ce15184`, `e03cef7`; task 3 finished in the lead session after the executor's connection dropped mid-task)
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Commits:** 3 (`ce15184`, `e03cef7`, `6af5485`)

## Accomplishments
- P0-04 (3 tests): one fan-out exercises positive OK / negative OK (verbatim relay message) / timeout against deterministic `LocalRelay` modes; per-relay classification recorded as a structured `relay_ack_classification` evidence observation; `send_event_to` never delivers to unlisted pool relays; external wss smoke stays opt-in advisory.
- P0-05 (22 tests): golden + generated NIP-17 fixtures prove wrap-chain construction (1059→13→rumor), tamper rejection before trusted processing, stable rumor identity across retries with fresh outer ids, and separate recipient/sender copies.
- P0-11/P0-12 (31 tests): local naddr resolution rejects malformed/wrong-kind/foreign references without fetching relay hints; auth probes enforce bearer vs cookie+Origin+CSRF boundaries, reject ID-only and cross-origin admin mutations, prove X-Order-Token/secret redaction in request and audit logs, and refuse unsupported topology (multi-process SQLite, CockroachDB); literal NIP-15 stall/product DTOs plus invalid-case fixtures.
- P0-13 (21 tests): one `Decimal(str(value))` boundary, per-line/per-shipping `ROUND_CEILING`, rejection of stale/empty/zero/nonfinite/failed/provenance-free quotes before reservation; measured float bound recorded deterministically (max rel `7.46e-17`, max abs `0` sat).
- P0-14 (12 tests): the closure gate diffs spec<->registry<->schema.py<->state.py both directions, proves exhaustive transition classification and fixture coverage, enforces Release-A kind exclusion, checks frozen-identifier spellings, registers the topology refusal, and asserts complete P0-01..P0-14 evidence on the live accumulator — self-skipping on any subset selection.
- PINS.md gained the spec-§2 qualification-results section (NIP-32 namespace `org.gammamarkets.protocol` pinned, security/ACK/FX summaries, platform matrix); the D-11 Approval section remains PENDING for owner sign-off.
- Final suite: `make verify` 220/220 on SQLite and on PostgreSQL (`postgres://localhost/gamma_qual`); `make verify-protocol` runs 69 protocol-scoped tests with the evidence-closure assertion correctly self-skipping; ruff clean.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Closure gate spec-extraction edge cases**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (P0-14 test development, lead session)
- **Issue:** §4 table extraction false-positived on field enumerations (`` `state` (`pending|…`) ``), column parsing dropped digit-bearing names (`bolt11_enc`), the §14 topology anchor wraps across lines, and `config.args` is never empty under `testpaths` config — the evidence-closure skip would have been unconditional.
- **Fix:** table introductions require PK|FK|UNIQUE evidence in the paren; column regex admits digits; §14 anchor checked on whitespace-normalized text; selection state compares `config.args` against configured `testpaths` so bare `pytest` counts as complete but `pytest <path>` self-skips.
- **Files modified:** tests/qualification/test_p0_14_contract_closure.py, harness/evidence.py
- **Verification:** 12/12 P0-14 tests pass; evidence closure asserts live on `make verify` and self-skips on `-m protocol` and file-targeted runs
- **Committed in:** 6af5485

**2. [Rule 2 - Missing] `note_observation` defined but never wired**
- **Found during:** Task 3 (PINS.md qualification-results authoring)
- **Issue:** the evidence plugin's structured-observation hook existed but no test used it, so per-relay ACK results lacked a citable manifest record.
- **Fix:** `test_positive_negative_and_timeout_acks_classified_per_relay` records the per-relay `relay_ack_classification` observation; PINS.md points at it.
- **Files modified:** tests/qualification/test_p0_04_relay_ack.py
- **Committed in:** 6af5485

**3. [Rule 1 - Lint] unused LifespanManager binding + import order**
- **Found during:** Task 3 closeout (`ruff check .`)
- **Fix:** dropped the unused `as manager` binding in `harness/host.py` (comment clarified); ruff-sorted test imports.
- **Committed in:** 6af5485

### Infrastructure Note

The `gsd-executor` subagent (beeff68d) completed Tasks 1-2 and most of Task 3 before a connection error ended the session; the resume attempt failed twice on the same error. Task 3 was finished in the lead session following the same plan/executor protocol: uncommitted work assessed, the P0-14 closure module written and iterated to green, PINS.md completed, full suite verified on both dialects, committed as `6af5485`.
