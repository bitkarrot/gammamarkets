# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-conformance-profile-contract-phase-0
    plan: 03
    provides: pinned host checkout, harness db/schema/tx adapters, qualification evidence pipeline
provides:
  - Production `gammamarkets` package discovered/migrated/route-mounted by the REAL host loader (LNBITS_EXTENSIONS_PATH + config.json + m001 through migrate_extension_database)
  - m001 schema: all 21 §4 merchant/catalog/outbox tables + indexes, literal column names/constraints
  - DomainTransaction: explicit BEGIN IMMEDIATE (raw aiosqlite) on SQLite / conn.begin() on PG; markdown-safe write path avoiding rewrite_values stripping
  - Strict §12 settings validation + topology refusal + OQ3 audit-capture startup warning in gammamarkets_start
  - crypto.py: AES-256-GCM envelopes (key_version + 96-bit nonce + tag) with length-prefixed AAD, purpose-separated HMAC-SHA256 privacy indexes, canonical public tokens
  - keystore.py: generate/import/sign/public_key/delete/rewrap/stale_merchants + encrypted export/restore; no raw nsec persisted/logged/returned
  - security.py: RFC 9457 problem+json boundary, cookie Origin+CSRF vs bearer mutation rules (cookie wins when both present), relay URL validator
  - §5.1 merchant API (create/get/patch/import-key/publish/relay-health/notifications/test-send/deactivate) + §5.2 catalog API (catalogs/products/collections/shipping CRUD + images + events dry-run)
  - services/events.py: deterministic unsigned builders — 30402/30405/30406/0/31989/31990/5 + NIP-15 30017/30018 projection with CompatibilityError on currency mismatch
  - services/outbox.py: shared transactional enqueue with revision supersession + dependency edges (portable select-then-insert SQL)
affects: [02-02 publication worker consumes outbox intents + event builders; 02-03 orders reuse DomainTransaction + security boundary; 02-04 admin UI consumes §5.1/5.2 routes]

actuals:
  tokens: ~140000   # executed in lead session; subagent layer unavailable, work done inline
  tasks: 3
  commits: 1

tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Real-loader install fixture: symlink package into tmp LNBITS_EXTENSIONS_PATH, reset extension install rows in shared core DB, host's own enable endpoint per user
    - DomainTransaction for every multi-statement write; raw connection preserves markdown/JSON byte fidelity (Pitfall 3)
    - sys.modules purge + importlib re-import so module-level Database() binds the per-test data folder
    - problem_boundary decorator: mutation enforcement + RFC 9457 conversion inside the route (dependency-raised errors bypass handlers); CSRF cookie issued on success AND error responses
    - Publishable-mutation pattern: bump revision, enqueue outbox intent, wire dependency edges — all in one DomainTransaction

key-files:
  created:
    - gammamarkets/__init__.py, config.json, db.py, migrations.py, settings.py
    - gammamarkets/crypto.py, keystore.py, security.py, models.py
    - gammamarkets/services/{__init__,merchant,catalog,events,outbox}.py
    - gammamarkets/views.py, views_api.py
    - gammamarkets/templates/gammamarkets/index.html, static/gammamarkets/probe.txt
    - tests/runtime/{conftest,test_install,test_db,test_crypto_keystore,test_merchant_api,test_catalog_api,test_catalog_events}.py
  modified:
    - tests/conftest.py (runtime marker)
    - Makefile (verify-runtime target)
    - evidence/{REPORT.md,manifest.json} (regenerated, 296/297)

key-decisions:
  - "Template name resolution (OQ2 verified): template_renderer(['gammamarkets']) resolves literal 'templates/gammamarkets/index.html' relative to the extension dir — the spike renders 200 through the real loader."
  - "Static files (OQ1 disposition): gammamarkets_static_files declarative list is host-mounted and allowed — the PINS ban covers extension code instantiating FileResponse/StaticFiles, not the declaration; mount verified via /gammamarkets/static/probe.txt."
  - "Install mechanics (OQ5): fixture symlinks the repo package into a tmp LNBITS_EXTENSIONS_PATH/extensions dir; core-DB install rows are reset per boot for fresh-install semantics."
  - "config.json permissions (OQ4): parsed and accepted by the loader; no runtime enforcement observed for Python extensions — recorded, no code depends on it."
  - "Migration split (OQ7): m001 covers merchant/catalog/outbox-intent tables; m002 (02-03) adds orders/payments/inventory/idempotency/email + schema-only inbox_events/order_messages; peer_relays/relay_cursors/migration_jobs defer to Phase 3/4."
  - "Audit capture (OQ3): deployment-level disposition — qualified deployments keep lnbits_audit_log_request_body/query_params/path_params disabled; start hook emits structured warning, admin banner surfaces it, test flips flags on and asserts the warning."
  - "Cookie-vs-bearer: a request carrying a cookie uses cookie rules even with a bearer header present — prevents bearer bypass of Origin/CSRF."
  - "Kind-5 tombstone enqueues carry the bumped aggregate revision so supersession retires older pending publish intents for the same aggregate."
  - "Collection losing its last active member enqueues a kind-5 tombstone but keeps the local row — §6.2 forbids publishing an empty collection, and the merchant may re-add members later."
  - "Product intent enqueues AFTER collection republish intents so dependency edges bind to live (non-superseded) rows — matches §8.6 ordering 30406 -> 30405 -> 30402."

# Spec deltas / deferred
# - NIP-15 30017 stall builder + catalog publish_nip15 flag exist; stall
#   intents enqueue on catalog/product changes but the publisher worker is
#   02-02. Variation nip15_product_id persistence happens at publish time
#   (builder computes deterministically; dry-run does not persist).
# - rate_limit_buckets / task_leases tables exist but are unused until
#   02-02/02-03 workers land.
# - GET /merchants/{id}/outbox + retry delta routes deferred to 02-02 with
#   the worker (B2 consumes them).
