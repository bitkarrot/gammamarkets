# Phase 2 — Security

This is an ASVS-1 mitigation review of the 25 threats authored in plans 02-01 through 02-04, plus T-205-01 added when UAT introduced digital delivery. `threats_open: 0` means all 26 specified mitigations were found in the extension and exercised. [Current implementation CI run 36352552899](https://github.com/bitkarrot/infinitemarkets/actions/runs/36352552899) passed lint and all four blocking Linux profiles on `021c402`; human UAT passed 3/3, including payment/privacy wording, responsive accessibility, theme isolation and merchant operations. The pinned LNbits source was not changed. Optional public-relay and real-funding-provider interoperability remain outside this Phase 2 sign-off.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Data crossing | Control |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Merchant browser → admin API | Session, configuration, identity import, order actions | Host owner authentication plus extension Origin/CSRF validation, legal actions and ciphertext key custody |
| Anonymous browser → public API | Cart, delivery information, idempotency key and private order token | Server-priced quote, stock claim, bounded rates, fragment-to-memory token extraction and header-only status access |
| Extension → LNbits wallet/database | Invoice request and authoritative payment record | UTC readiness, wallet/amount/hash/expiry correlation before invoice delivery and again at settlement; no retrying an uncertain invoice creation |
| Workers → extension database | Durable outbox, settlement, email and reservation writes | Conditional state changes, fencing tokens and per-recipient claims |
| Extension → Nostr relays | Signed public catalog/profile projections and relay ACKs | Validated relay targets, recipient-limited sending and durable ACK evidence; no order or payment authority crosses this boundary |
| Public theme → admin interface | Merchant-controlled token values | Allowlist, contrast gates and `.gm-public` CSS scope |

| T-205-01 | Information disclosure | digital delivery content released before payment or published | high | mitigate | Added after UAT (2026-09-27). `products.delivery_enc` AEAD at rest (`services/catalog.py`); only the owner-scoped admin API decrypts it; `services/orders.py::digital_delivery` returns content only for `confirmed/processing/completed` without payment exception or oversell; never in public product JSON/HTML or NIP-99 events; buyer UI renders it as text with http(s) links only (no innerHTML). `test_order_saga.py::test_digital_delivery_revealed_only_after_confirmed_payment`, `test_public_contract.py`, `buyer.spec.ts` | closed |

A shareable order link intentionally contains a token in its **URL fragment** until the receiving page strips it. The protection is that the fragment is not sent in HTTP paths, queries or referrers; the link itself must be kept private. No broader claim that the token never appears in a URL is made.

## Accepted Risks Log

No accepted risks. A relay can retain already-public catalog events despite a kind-5 deletion; checkout always checks the canonical database instead of trusting relay availability or stock.
