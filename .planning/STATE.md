# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core value:** A merchant can sell one authoritative inventory safely through LNbits-backed web and Nostr flows without duplicate invoices, double allocation, or relay delivery being mistaken for payment truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Release A: Safe Web Commerce

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Release A — Safe Web Commerce)
Plan: 4 plans written (02-01..02-04), checker-verified, 4/4 implemented
Status: Executing closeout — Linux CI, human security/UX review and safe demo deployment outstanding
Last activity: 2026-09-27 — local full qualification and Chromium checks passed on both databases

Progress: [██████████] 100% of written implementation plans; only Phase 1 of 4 is formally complete

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6

| Phase 02 P01 | multi-session | 3 tasks | 18 created + 4 modified |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md and the normative specification.

- Runtime identity is `gammamarkets`.
- Direct qualified `nostr-sdk` is the baseline; other relay extensions are unqualified adapter candidates.
- GSD Phase 1 is the contract's Phase 0 evidence gate; it contains no production runtime implementation.
- Release order is A web commerce, B Gamma NIP-17, C legacy interop/migration.
- Checkout preserves Editorial/Guided/Compact merchant presets with responsive mobile fallback and invariant payment semantics.
- Merchant order operations use a split list/detail workspace with embedded chronology.
- Public themes use preset, Brand Basics, and guarded Advanced Tokens tiers; admin styling stays host-controlled.
- Phase 2 UI planning must load `.devin/skills/sketch-findings-gammamarkets/` and produce a binding UI contract.
- [Phase 1]: Plan 01-01 shipped the permanent qualification harness: pins/provenance (P0-01), SDK security boundary (P0-02), host contract boundary (P0-03), one canonical make verify + evidence bundle, CI blocking matrix. — Everything later phases build depends on the pinned host/SDK/database contract being proven reproducible; the harness is permanent regression infrastructure (D-05), not disposable qualification code.
- [Phase 1]: PG queue claims run as lock-select/update/fetch in one transaction with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED: SQLAlchemy 1.4 + asyncpg returns no rows from raw text() UPDATE...RETURNING (01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Idempotent intent inserts use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING with deterministic ids: PostgreSQL aborts transactions on constraint violations, so IntegrityError catch-and-continue is not dialect-portable (01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Outbox publication evidence is durable and append-only, recorded separately from the fenced claim-token outcome write: models the section 8.6 crash point and makes stale-claim reconstruction honest (01-02)
- [Phase 1]: Cancelled orders retain their payment projection for late-settlement detection; BOLT11 delivery and payment-request enqueue happen only for invoice_pending orders (spec 8.2 step 3, decision 24)
- [Phase 2]: Host `deactivate_all` is a persisted editable admin setting — runtime fixtures must reset it in the shared core DB, and `sys.modules` must be purged before re-import so `Database()` binds the right data folder (02-01)
- [Phase 2]: Host `rewrite_values` HTML-strips raw execute/fetch params — markdown/JSON payloads only persist via `insert`/`update` or DomainTransaction raw statements (02-01)
- [Phase 2]: Cookie auth wins when a request carries both cookie and bearer headers — prevents bearer bypass of Origin/CSRF (02-01)
- [Phase 2]: Kind-5 tombstone intents carry the bumped aggregate revision so supersession retires stale pending publishes; product intents enqueue AFTER collection republishes so dependency edges bind to live rows (02-01)

### Pending Todos

- Obtain current-revision Linux x86_64 and ARM64 CI runs for SQLite and PostgreSQL after an authorized push.
- Complete human buyer/merchant UAT and security/accessibility sign-off in `02-UAT.md` and `02-SECURITY.md`.
- Move the running port 5099 demo to the current backend without deleting its data; recheck the quote route before buyer checkout.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 local automated verification passed on macOS, not Linux CI; code remains local and Phase 2 is not formally complete (`02-VERIFICATION.md`).
- Port 5099 serves old backend code without the new quote route, while its static assets now use the route; it currently fails closed for checkout.
- Release B cannot claim production readiness without deployed egress controls and external-client evidence.
- Release C requires a live scarce-stock payable-invoice cutover rehearsal.

## Deferred Items
