"""P0-06: transaction/fencing/last-unit/FK evidence (QUAL-06).

Executable models for spec sections 8.2 (step 1), 14 (transaction adapter,
idempotency, multi-worker behavior), 4.12/4.16 (FKs, task leases), and 7.1
(the order state machine with order_events audit rows).

Covers:

(a) last-unit concurrency: N parallel buyers each claiming the final unit of
    a finite-stock product through the section 8.2 step-1 conditional UPDATE
    inside one adapter transaction — exactly one winner, stock_reserved
    equals stock_on_hand at most, all losers rolled back with no partial rows
    (SQLite: BEGIN IMMEDIATE serialization; PostgreSQL: concurrent
    connections with row locking);
(b) deadlock avoidance: two concurrent multi-item claims locking products in
    opposite insertion order both complete (sorted-id locking per section 8.2);
(c) rollback completeness: a failed guard mid multi-item claim rolls back
    stock increments, reservation rows, and order transitions atomically;
(d) host auto-commit splitting: the host's auto-committing helper commits the
    open domain transaction mid-flight, so its row — AND the domain rows
    written so far — survive the intended rollback; the adapter alone rolls
    back cleanly, and the adapter never calls the host helpers in-transaction;
(e) fencing: task_leases fencing_token is monotonically increasing; a stale
    fenced write affects zero rows and is rejected, the current-token write
    succeeds;
(f) SQLite FK enforcement: orphan inserts into inventory_reservations,
    order_items, and relay_publications fail;
(g) idempotency: UNIQUE-scope duplicate order inserts conflict rather than
    double-inserting (check-then-insert is never used, section 14);

plus the exhaustive section 7.1 legal/illegal transition table with
order_events audit rows (section 17 state-machine test requirement).

Runs on the selected profile dialect (SQLite locally; the four blocking
profiles run it in CI per D-03).
