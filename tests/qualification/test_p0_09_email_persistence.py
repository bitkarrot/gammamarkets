"""P0-09: email/token persistence evidence (QUAL-09).

Executable section 8.8/11.3/11.4 model runs proving:

(a) two merchant recipients of the same event produce two queue rows, both
    delivered independently, and a duplicate enqueue of the same
    (order, channel, event_type, recipient) is a successful no-op;
(b) revoked customer consent: opt-out sets email_opt_in=false and cancels
    that order's queued customer rows;
(c) delayed confirmation beyond idempotency retention: idempotency_records
    expire after 24h (checkout records retained through invoice expiry +
    24h) while the token's AEAD copy remains renderable for the
    notification lifetime and is erased on expiry — after expiry the magic
    link cannot be rendered and the hash no longer matches;
(d) token rotation/revocation invalidates the old hash and erases the
    encrypted copy immediately;
(e) no plaintext persistence: raw recipient addresses and raw tokens never
    appear in the database — byte-level search of the SQLite file, and
    per-column scan on PostgreSQL;
(f) hashes are not reversible and lookups succeed only via the equality
    hash with the correct key purpose (a wrong-purpose hash does not match).
