"""P0-03: LNbits host contract probes (QUAL-03).

Probes against the real pinned host (e336fe1) with FakeWallet funding:

- (a) invoice metadata: create_invoice with extension="gammamarkets",
  external_id="gammamarkets:<uuid>", sat amount, and the gammamarkets extra
  tag; the persisted core payment row records extension, exact external_id,
  wallet id, and amount, and exact external_id lookup retrieves it (the
  section 8.2 reconciliation key);
- (b) invoice-listener lifecycle: a listener registered via
  task_manager.register_invoice_listener(coro, name="gammamarkets") receives
  the settled Payment carrying our extension/external_id when the FakeWallet
  invoice is paid through the host's own settlement path (pay_invoice);
- (c) owned-handle cancellation: cancelling only the extension-owned handle
  stops our listener while unrelated registered tasks survive — the host's
  cancel-everything API is never invoked (section 10);
- (d) no durable callback delivery: after a simulated restart (second app
  boot), the previously registered listener receives nothing, and the newly
  settled payment is discoverable by exact external_id query — proving the
  reconciliation path (query, not replayed callback) is the only recovery
  route (sections 8.3/8.7).

Observed lifecycle and failure semantics (documented for the report):

- register_invoice_listener returns a Task named "{name}_invoice_listener";
  cancel_task(task) removes it from the dispatch list and cancels the
  asyncio task — scoped cancellation, other listeners untouched.
- Listener registration is in-memory only: it does not survive an app
  restart. Settled payments persist in the core database and are recovered
  by exact external_id query.
- FakeWallet settlement reaches listeners through the host's real pipeline:
  pay_invoice -> FakeWallet queue -> fundingsource_invoice_producer ->
  update_invoice_from_paid_invoices_stream (marks SUCCESS in core DB) ->
  task_manager.invoice_queue -> dispatch to all registered listeners.
