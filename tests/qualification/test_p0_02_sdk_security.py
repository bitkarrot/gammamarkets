"""P0-02: SDK security/FFI/crypto probes (QUAL-02).

SDK-internal probes (blocking under D-13/D-16):

- invalid-event rejection: tampered content (id mismatch), tampered
  signatures, malformed ids, and malformed JSON are rejected by the SDK
  verification path before any trusted processing — clean errors, not
  crashes;
- oversized NIP-44 input: a multi-megabyte crafted ciphertext is rejected
  with bounded wall time and no unbounded memory growth (tracemalloc);
- paused-signing AUTH boundedness: a client with no auth credential
  (signing not performed) connected to an AUTH_FLOOD relay shows bounded
  work, no exception storm, and stays responsive;
- the tested binary identity is recorded (installed native library).

Admission-modeled check (extension-side defense in depth only, D-16):

- known-ID repetition: an id-registry dedupe admits a valid event id
  exactly once.

If nostr-sdk 0.44.8 fails any blocking SDK-internal check, Phase 1 stays
blocked (D-13/D-14) — extension-level input checks cannot waive it (D-16).
