"""P0-07: cancellation/invoice saga race evidence (QUAL-07).

Executable section 8.2/8.3/8.4/8.7 model runs against the controllable fake
LNbits payment boundary. For each cancellation state in received,
invoice_pending, awaiting_payment and each invoice-creation outcome in
success, definitive rejection, timeout/unknown: pause the saga at the
documented boundary, cancel, then deliver the outcome and restart the model.

Asserts (never trusting the happy path):

- stock releases exactly once (double cancellation does not double-release);
- core_external_id correlation survives cancellation;
- a cancelled order never reopens and never receives a delivered BOLT11 or
  payment request;
- no second invoice is ever created (the fake counts create_invoice calls
  per order);
- a settlement after cancellation sets payment_exception and keeps the order
  cancelled;
- reconciliation of creation_unknown attaches exactly one discovered invoice
  by external id;
- the multi-match critical exception path: two core payments with one
  external id quarantines the order, nothing auto-delivered.
