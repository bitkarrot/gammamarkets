"""P0-10: SMTP boolean boundary evidence (QUAL-10).

Executable section 8.8 send-path model runs proving:

(a) only ``True`` enters ``sent``: True -> sent with sent_at; False, a
    raised exception, and recipient rejection all return the row to pending
    with bounded unclassified retry ``min(2^attempts * 30s, 4h)`` and after
    ``EMAIL_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` (5) enter ``failed`` — never sent, never a
    category label beyond the bounded last_error code;
(b) suppressed rows are marked suppressed without any SMTP call when
    unconfigured/disabled/revoked;
(c) rate limiting before delivery via rate_limit_buckets keyed on
    recipient_hash (customer, 8/hour) and merchant id (merchant alerts,
    60/hour) — never the raw address — and excess waits rather than
    delivering;
(d) log exposure: the model's structured logs never contain recipient
    addresses or bearer links (the magic-link token) — correlation is by
    order id and event type only;
(e) queue uniqueness dedupes INTENT, not SMTP delivery: a crash after SMTP
    acceptance before commit may re-deliver on resume — exactly-once intent
    with at-least-once delivery semantics under that crash point.
