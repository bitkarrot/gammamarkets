"""P0-08: restart-at-checkpoint recovery closure evidence (QUAL-08).

The restart matrix over the executable models: kill at every section 8.2
saga boundary (after reservation before invoice call; after invoice before
attach; after attach before enqueue; between settlement and callback — the
section 17 failure drill where the fake core payment is settled but the
invoice-paid callback is lost), at inbox checkpoints (admitted-not-validated,
validated-not-dispatched), and at outbox checkpoints (claimed not published;
partially published with durable accepted targets; lease expired mid-claim).

After each restart: every row resumes or terminates explicitly (no row left
in claimed/publishing/creating without a live lease or terminal state), only
missing relay targets retry while accepted targets are never resent, the
canonical rumor id and positive-ACK evidence survive restart, stale claims
requeue only via claim-token CAS reconstruction from durable
relay_publications, and relay cursors do not regress (crash before EOSE
leaves the prior cursor intact).

Two settlement-side recovery cases join the matrix (section 8.7 bullet 1,
section 8.3, section 17):

(i) settlement-callback loss — reconciliation queries the core payment
    status and confirms exactly once via the section 8.3 transaction, then
    a duplicate callback and a reconciliation rerun are no-ops;
(ii) pre-reservation crash resume — a committed received order is resumed
    by idempotently beginning section 8.2; a double resume neither
    double-reserves nor double-invoices.

Also covers duplicate gift wraps including the merchant's own sender copy
being recovered as a sender copy without dispatching a domain command
(section 8.5 step 7 semantics at the queue-model level).
