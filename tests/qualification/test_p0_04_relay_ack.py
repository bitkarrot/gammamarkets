"""P0-04: relay ACK classification + targeted routing (QUAL-04).

Deterministic local relays are authoritative (section 9.1): an accepting
relay produces a positive OK, a rejecting relay a negative OK carrying the
relay's message, and a silent relay a timeout — all surfaced per-relay by
the SDK's ``SendEventOutput`` (verified against nostr-sdk 0.44.8:
``.success`` is a list of RelayUrl, ``.failed`` maps RelayUrl -> reason
string, where a negative OK carries the relay's message verbatim and a
missing OK surfaces as ``'timeout'``).

WebSocket send success alone is NEVER delivery evidence (section 8.6):
publication is proven only by the relay's OK classification. And an explicit
target list must never fan out to unlisted relays (section 9.3).

The optional ``wss://nostr.net`` smoke (``GAMMA_QUAL_SMOKE_RELAY``) is
advisory-only per section 21.27: ephemeral throwaway key, non-sensitive
synthetic event, never a substitute for the local evidence.
